## Elderflower Prosecco Cocktail

Careful with this one. Bubbly don't keep, so you might as well kill the bottle, right?

* 1/2 oz St. Germain elderflower liqueur
* 1/4 oz fresh lime juice
* 4 oz Prosecco

Add St. Germain and lime juice to a champagne flute. Top with Prosecco, pouring slowly.

**Notes**

Any midrange Prosecco will work fine. Cupcake is a good choice.
