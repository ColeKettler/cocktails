## Mimosa

A perfect way to end or start the day. I think it's fun to experiment with the variety of orange that you're using.

* 2 oz fresh-squeezed orange juice (from an actual orange) (that you actually held)
* 1/4 oz Cointreau
* 5 oz Prosecco

Add orange juice and Cointreau to a chilled Champagne flute. Top with Prosecco, pouring slowly. Garnish with breakfast.

**Notes**

Any midrange Prosecco will work fine. Cupcake is a good choice.
