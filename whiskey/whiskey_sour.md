## Whiskey Sour

I like this drink served up with an egg white foam. Super refreshing, especially after the workout you get while shaking. You've _earned_ it.

* 2 oz bourbon
* 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
* 1/2 oz 2:1 simple syrup
* 1 egg white
* 8-10 drops Angostura bitters

Shake bourbon, lemon juice, and simple syrup with ice. Double-strain into a chilled mixing glass. Discard ice from shaker. Pour mixing glass back into shaker and add egg white. Shake vigorously for at least 45 seconds. Flex in the mirror. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Wait a few moments for the foam to separate and rise. Decorate foam with bitters. Garnish glass with a slice of lemon.

**Notes**

A wheated bourbon like Maker's Mark is a good choice for a sweeter cocktail. Higher-proof high-rye bourbon like Wild Turkey 101 will make for a boozier, more layered drink. I like it with 101.
